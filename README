README for clothing distribution base code

Sharlee Climer, Sept. 2022

Unzip and untar package:

    gunzip clothing_src.tar.gz
    tar -xvf clothing_src.tar 
    
Change directories, type 'make' to compile, and 'clothing' to see command line arguments:
    
    cd clothing_src
    make
    ./clothing
    
Optional: reduce screen output by changing values for VERBOSE and QUIET in 'clothing.h' and recompiling
